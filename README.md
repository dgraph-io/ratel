## Post-mortem

PS. Update this text if(when) necessary.

We used to run Ratel along with the main Dgraph binary(Core Code). But it has been removed and some code here has become obsolete. Like the ones in the "Server" directory, some processes in Bash Script and so on. Now we have created a unique image for Ratel. See https://hub.docker.com/r/dgraph/ratel

The UI available at http://play.dgraph.io/ is kept in an S3 Bucket and distributed via CDN. Communication between the UI, documentation and parts of the Tour uses a shared dataset. Its configuration is done through the config file in `./server/play-dgraph-io.nginx.conf`.
